# The kiosk web client

This is a simple kiosk written in React that allows the user to flip through a collection of images with actions "forward", "back", and "pause".  This client will run on a Raspberry Pi in browser kiosk mode and will connect to a web socket server to receive images as they are arrive to the Pi.
