# piosk

A simple framework for delivering images to a **Raspberry Pi** powered kiosk.  Images are delivered to the kiosk over wifi to a raspberry pi hot-spot from an electron screen-capture "Producer".  For security concerns the raspberry pi does not have to be on the Internet. 

## What's included

- Documentation
- Windows screen capture and bluetooth publisher
- A browser based "digital picture frame"-like kiosk capable of running on the Raspberry Pi.
- scripts needed to keep your Raspberry PI bluetooth connection up and running.
