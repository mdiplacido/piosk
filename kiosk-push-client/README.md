# PIOSK Push Client

This Application was bootstrapped with React + TypeScript starter template: https://electronforge.io/templates

using commands:

    > npm install -g electron-forge
    > electron-forge init kiosk-push-client --template=react-typescript
    > cd kiosk-push-client
    > electron-forge start

## Notes

* I upgraded React from 15 to 16, this was fairly manually with odd linter bug here and there.  See commits on master to get a feel for how this was done.  Eg.
