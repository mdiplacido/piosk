# Todo list

- for package prod builds I see this in the console when the devtool is loaded:
    - Uncaught Error: React is running in production mode, but dead code elimination has not been applied. Read how to correctly configure React for production: https://fb.me/react-perf-use-the-production-build

- move dev only packages to the devDependencies section of package.json
