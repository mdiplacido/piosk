# Todo list

- for package prod builds I see this in the console when the devtool is loaded:
    - Uncaught Error: React is running in production mode, but dead code elimination has not been applied. Read how to correctly configure React for production: https://fb.me/react-perf-use-the-production-build

- move dev only packages to the devDependencies section of package.json

- for save settings feature:
    - show spinner
    - update reducer to reflect the config change
    - verify that it propagates
    - show error toast loading and saving config.
    - update settings page to allow it to go into edit mode
